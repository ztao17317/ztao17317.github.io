I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at William & Mary, under the supervision of [Prof. Qun Li](https://www.cs.wm.edu/~liqun/). Before coming to W&M, I got my bachelor degree in Mathematics, [Actuarial Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuarial_science), Computer Science from University of Iowa (UIOWA) in 2015.

My research interest falls in Machine Learning, Deep learning, Distributed Machine Learning, Edge Computing, Convex and Non-convex Optmization, Model Efficiency, Quantum Computing.
